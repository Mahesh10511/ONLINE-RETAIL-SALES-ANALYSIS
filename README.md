# ONLINE-RETAIL-SALES-ANALYSIS
# Problem Statement
Online retail businesses generate large volumes of sales data, but without proper analysis, identifying customer trends, top-selling products, and revenue patterns becomes difficult. There is a need for a system that can process transactional data, uncover insights, and support data-driven decision-making through clear visualization and analytical techniques.
# Objectives
To analyze online retail transaction data and derive meaningful insights.
To identify key sales metrics such as total revenue, top products, and customer contributions.
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding patterns and trends.
To apply RFM (Recency–Frequency–Monetary) analysis for customer segmentation.
To build a simple sales forecasting model based on historical data.
To generate visualizations and reports for clear interpretation of business performance.
# Feature
